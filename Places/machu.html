       <p class="paragraph"><strong>Why I want to visit this beautiful place: </strong> I’ve always been curious about ancient civilizations, so visiting Machu Picchu would be incredible. Hiking through the Andes and finally seeing the ruins sounds like an unforgettable experience. It’s amazing how it was built without modern tools and still stands today. Sitting on one of the terraces and taking in the view would be so peaceful. Watching the sunrise over the ruins would be breathtaking. It’s one of those places that feels like a must-see in life.</p>
