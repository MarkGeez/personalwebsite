       <p class="paragraph"><strong>Why I want to visit this beautiful place: </strong>I’ve always wanted to visit the Colosseum because Roman history fascinates me. Walking through the ruins and imagining the gladiator fights would be surreal. It’s crazy to think that it’s still standing after so many centuries. Seeing the underground tunnels and the seating area up close would be so interesting. Sitting in one of the stands and taking it all in would be unforgettable. A sunset photo of the Colosseum would be perfect. </strong> </p>

       <p class="paragraph"><strong>Details about this beautiful place: </strong>The Colosseum is located in Rome, Italy, and was built between 72 and 80 AD under the rule of Emperor Vespasian and Titus. It could hold between 50,000 and 80,000 spectators and was used for gladiator contests and public spectacles. Despite damage from earthquakes and stone robbers, it remains one of the most recognizable structures in the world.
