       <p class="paragraph"><strong>Why I want to visit this beautiful place: </strong>Walking along the Great Wall would feel like stepping into history. It’s incredible how it stretches for miles over mountains and valleys. Taking in the view from the top would be unforgettable. I’d love to sit on the wall and just take it all in. Thinking about the effort it took to build it is mind-blowing. Getting a photo with the wall stretching into the distance would be a must. </p>

       <p class="paragraph"><strong>Details about this beautiful place: </strong>The Great Wall of China is over 21,000 kilometers long and was built to protect Chinese states from invasions. Construction began as early as the 7th century BC, but the most famous sections were built by the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644). The wall is made of stone, brick, and earth, and includes watchtowers and fortresses.</p>
