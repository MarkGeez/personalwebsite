       <p class="paragraph"><strong>Why I want to visit this beautiful place: </strong> The Pyramids of Giza have always fascinated me because they’re so massive and ancient. Standing next to them and realizing how huge they are would be humbling. I’d love to see the Sphinx up close too. Thinking about how they were built without modern tools is mind-blowing. Taking a photo at sunset with the pyramids in the background would be amazing. Riding a camel near the pyramids would be a fun experience.</p>

       <p class="paragraph"><strong>Details about this beautiful place: </strong> The Pyramids of Giza are located near Cairo, Egypt, and were built during the Fourth Dynasty (around 2580–2560 BC). The largest, the Great Pyramid, was built for Pharaoh Khufu and originally stood at 146 meters tall. The nearby Sphinx, with the body of a lion and the head of a pharaoh, is believed to represent strength and wisdom.</p>
