        <u>Childhood Years</u>
      </h2>
      
      <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was born at Quezon City and from ages one to seven, I lived in SM Homes, North Caloocan, with my family.<sup>1</sup> It was a simple and peaceful neighborhood where I learned to play with other kids, and my parents took care of me with much love.<sup>2</sup> 
        I remember my mom always there for me, and my dad working hard to support us.<sup>3</sup> At the age of eight, things changed when we moved to our province in Ilocos Norte.<sup>4</sup> My mom went to Hong Kong as an <abbr title="Overseas Filipino Worker">OFW,</abbr>
         and my family struggled in the province.<sup>5</sup> Life was tough there, especially with strict rules and the mistreatment we experienced, which was difficult for me to understand at the time.<sup>6</sup> I often missed my mom, but we had to move forward in life.<sup>7</sup> 
         At nine years old, my mom finally came back from Hong Kong, and life started to improve.<sup>8</sup> The family reunited, and we felt a sense of relief as we are finally with each other again.<sup>9</sup> Things slowly became more stable, and I was able to enjoy a more normal childhood once again.<sup>10</sup> 
          My parents worked hard to make sure we had what we needed, and I appreciated their sacrifices.<sup>11</sup> It was a time of change and growth for me, learning how to adapt and persevere despite the challenges.<sup>12</sup> I'll always remember how resilient my parents were, and how they managed to keep our family together despite the hardships.<sup>13</sup> 
          During this time, I also discovered the importance of family.<sup>14</sup> I understood that even though life was hard, my parents always had my back.<sup>15</sup> We weren’t rich, but we had a lot of love for one another, and that made all the difference.<sup>16</sup> This chapter of my childhood shaped me into a person who valued family and hard work.<sup>17</sup>
          I'll never forget my friends who made me who I am today. They were the friends who made my childhood bearable even though there are hardships.<sup>19</sup> Looking back, 
          I’m grateful for those early years, as they taught me resilience, the importance of family, and the value of staying strong no matter what.<sup>20</sup>

        <h2 class="h2Top"><u>Teenage Years</u></h2>
        <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was in my teenage years, we moved from Caloocan to Sampaloc, Manila.<sup>1</sup> I attended <abbr title="E. Rodriguez Jr. High School">ERJHS</abbr> from seventh to twelfth grade, where I met many new people.<sup>2</sup> 
          The school was a big part of my life during this time, and it’s where I made some of my best memories.<sup>3</sup> In ninth grade, the pandemic hit, and everything changed.<sup>4</sup> 
          The world went into lockdown, and like many others, I was stuck at home.<sup>5</sup> At first, I lived at my aunt’s house near SM North, unable to leave for months.<sup>6</sup> It was a strange time, and I missed seeing my friends and classmates.<sup>7</sup> 
          When the lockdown was finally lifted after six months, my father came to pick me up, and we returned to our home in Sampaloc.<sup>8</sup> The pandemic brought its challenges, but I learned how to adapt to the new normal.<sup>9</sup> 
          Despite being confined at home, I found ways to keep up with my studies.<sup>10</sup> I focused on staying connected with my friends online.<sup>11</sup> 
          The most memorable part of my teenage years was my relationship with my girlfriend.<sup>12</sup> We were schoolmates, and the memories we created together during our school days will always hold a special place in my heart.<sup>13</sup> 
          During my senior years in high school, the challenges of the pandemic seemed even more intense as we struggled with remote learning.<sup>14</sup> 
          The hardest part was working on the research paper for graduation.<sup>15</sup> It took a lot of effort, but with determination and support from my friends and teachers, I pushed through.<sup>16</sup> 
          My teenage years were full of growth, struggles, and unforgettable moments.<sup>17</sup> Each experience helped shape who I am today.<sup>18</sup> 
          I will always carry the memories of those times with me.<sup>19</sup> The bond I shared with my girlfriend and the resilience I gained during difficult times will always be important to me.<sup>20</sup></p>

            <u>College Years</u>
          </h2>
          <P class="paragraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I entered college, I decided to pursue an <abbr title="Bachelor of Science in Information Technology"></abbr>BSIT course because of my deep interest in computers.<sup>1</sup> I enrolled at the University of the East in Manila, and it was there that I faced new challenges, both academically and personally.<sup>2</sup> 
            College life was very different from high school, and I had to quickly adapt to the new environment.<sup>3</sup> The pressure of university studies was tough, but I kept pushing myself to do my best.<sup>4</sup> 
            I met new people and learned new things that helped expand my knowledge and skills, especially in technology, which I was so passionate about.<sup>5</sup> Some subjects were difficult, but I studied hard to overcome them.<sup>6</sup> 
            Despite facing many obstacles in college, I found ways to overcome them and keep moving forward.<sup>7</sup> I realized that time management was crucial in handling multiple assignments and exams.<sup>8</sup> 
            Balancing my studies with other aspects of life was challenging, but I learned how to stay focused.<sup>9</sup> There were times when I felt overwhelmed, but I reminded myself why I chose this path.<sup>10</sup> 
            Throughout my time at the University of the East, I also realized how important it was to surround myself with people who supported and encouraged me.<sup>11</sup> 
            Whether it was classmates, professors, or friends, their guidance played a key role in my growth during these years.<sup>12</sup> There were nights when I barely got any sleep because of deadlines and projects.<sup>13</sup> 
            Though the college journey wasn’t easy, I’m proud of how far I’ve come.<sup>14</sup> I’ve learned so much about myself and my field of study, and I feel prepared for the future ahead.<sup>15</sup> 
            There were moments when I doubted myself, but I refused to give up.<sup>16</sup> I kept reminding myself that every struggle was part of the learning process.<sup>17</sup> 
            As graduation approached, I looked back at all the hard work I had put in.<sup>18</sup> I felt a sense of accomplishment knowing that I had made it through with determination and perseverance.<sup>19</sup> 
            College taught me resilience, the value of pursuing my passions, and how to navigate life’s challenges with a positive mindset.<sup>20</sup>  </P>
